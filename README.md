# js-chess-engine
My version of the Javascript Chess Engine, created from watching video series provided by http://www.bluefever.net/Chess/index.html

I have followed the video series provided by Blue Fever on youtube, but I have entered all the code myself.
I have utilised the Brackets text editor and it's in built support for jslint. This means I have had to make some subtle code changes to what was included in the video series.
The initial commit was made after completing and testing all the code upto and including video no 38.
